Navigate to your Scratch directory inside your InnoTech directory
Create a folder called 'JsPageWarmup' and go into this folder
Initialize this folder as a git repo

Create a file called index.html
Create folders called css, images, pages, and js
Create a file called app.js in the js folder

In the index.html file add the boilerplate code using the VSCode shortcut
Connect to your JS file in your HTML code
Set up the debugger to connect to your JS file.

Create a git commit at this point outlining what you have done

Using your knowledge of JS & HTML, implement the following:
Create a page that contains a few elements with id's and classes (p tags, h tags, a tags, all kinds of tags)
Use the function document.getElementById() 3 times to get 3 different elements from the page and store them in their own variables
Change the style of all 3 of those tags to anything you like (modify the color, font-family, etc.)

Use the function document.getElementsByClassName() to grab all tags with a class name of your choice and store the result in a variable
Create a loop that goes through all elements in your variable and changes the innerText to be something random (just come up with something)

Make an appropriate git commit
Connect this local repo to a remote repo and push your code


Using only HTML & CSS, implement a simple card. This can be as simple as an image with a title under the image.
  Make sure you wrap the card in a container that you will be able to add more cards to later!
  Please use classes to style the card! If you use id's, you will not be able to add more cards later!
  Don't over complicate the HTML here, it really is as simple as:
  <section id="card_section">
    <article class="card_container">
      <img src="link_to_an_external_image">
      <h1>Card Title</h1>
    </article>
  </section>

In your JS, create a variable called card and set it to an object. This object should contain two keys:
  img_src: "link to the image"
  title: "The title of the card"
Please use an external link for the image (just to make things simple)
Using the built in function document.getElementById() grab the parent container for all the cards (the section from the example HTML)
  Store this container in a variable for later use.

Using the built in function document.createElement(), create an article tag
  Store this article in a variable for later use.
Using this variable, give this article the class "card_container"

Using the built in function document.createElement(), create an img tag
  Store this img in a variable for later use.
Using this variable, set the src of this image to the img_src stored in the object created before

Using the built in function appendChild, append the img tag to the article tag created.

Using the built in function document.createElement(), create an h1 tag.
  Store this h1 in a variable for later use.
Using this variable, change the innerText to be the title of the object created before.
Using the built in function appendChild, append the h1 tag to the article tag created.

Using the built in function appendChild, append the article tag to the parent container grabbed at the start of this.
You should now see the new card appear on the page.

Change your variable card to now be called cards. Change the value to be an array of objects instead of just one object.
  Make each object have the same keys but give each card a different img_src and title value.

Create a loop that will loop through each object in your array and in the loop: 
  Use the same techniques as above to create a new card that appears on the page for each object.
Research the built in function addEventListener() and see if you can use JS to change the background color of the page when the space bar is pressed:
